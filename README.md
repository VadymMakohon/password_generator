## 🔧 How it Works
The generate_password function takes several parameters:

- length: Total length of the password (default: 16 characters).

- special_chars: Minimum number of special characters to include (default: 1).
- uppercase: Minimum number of uppercase letters to include (default: 1).
- lowercase: Minimum number of lowercase letters to include (default: 1).

### Example Workflow:

1. The function ensures each specified character type is included by pre-selecting the required amount.
2. Any remaining characters are randomly selected from a pool of all character types.
3. The selected characters are shuffled for randomness and returned as a secure password.
